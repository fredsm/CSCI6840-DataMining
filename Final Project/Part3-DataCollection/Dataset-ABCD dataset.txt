ABCD (AIST Building Change Detection) dataset is a new labeled dataset, specially geared toward constructing and evaluating damage detection systems to identify whether buildings have been washed-away by tsunami.
Each datum in this dataset is a pair of pre- and post-tsunami aerial image patches, and encompasses a target building at the center of the patch.
The class label assigned to each patch pair (i.e. "washed-away" or "surviving") represents whether or not a building at the center of the pre-tsunami patch got wahshed-away by tsunami.

FloodNet dataset associated with three different computer vision tasks namely classication, semantic segmentation, and visual question answering (VQA).
FloodNet, provides high-resolution images taken from low altitude, as compared to satellite images which capture images from a higher altitude and may have obstructions from clouds and smoke. The characteristics of FloodNet bring more clarity to scenes and can help deep learning models in making more accurate decisions regarding post-disaster damage assessment.

Schematic of the directory configuration in the unzipped file is as follows:

./ABCDdataset/fixed-scale/
     |
     |- patch-pairs/
     |     |
     |     |- patch-pair_1.tif
     |     |- patch-pair_2.tif
     |          :
     |     |_ patch-pair_8506.tif
     |
     |_ 5fold-list/
           |
           |- cv1-train.csv
           |- cv1-test.csv
                :
           |_ cv5-test.csv

./ABCDdataset/resized/
     |
     |- patch-pairs/
     |     |
     |     |- patch-pair_1.tif
     |     |- patch-pair_2.tif
     |          :
     |     |_ patch-pair_8444.tif
     |
     |_ 5fold-list/
           |
           |- cv1-train.csv
           |- cv1-test.csv
                :
           |_ cv5-test.csv

The root directory contains two directories, fixed-scale/ and resized/, each corresponding to fixed-scale and resized patch pairs as mentioned above. Each of the directories has two subdirectories, patch-pairs/ and 5fold-list/. In patch-pairs/, "washed-away" and "surviving" patch pairs are stored in .tif format. Each .tif file comprises 6 channels, the first three channels for a pre-tsunami RGB patch and the last three channels for a post-tsunami patch. Also, for traceability of our experiment, in 5fold-list/ we prepared csv files that specify file names we actually used for our 5-fold cross validation. For example, cv1-train.csv and cv1-test.csv are training and test set for one of 5 folds, and so on. These csv files take the following format:
patch-pair_14.tif,1
patch-pair_600.tif,1
:
patch-pair_34.tif,0

where each record corresponds to each tiff file, the first field is file name and the second field represents class label of the file in the first field ("1" for "washed-away" and "0" for "surviving").
